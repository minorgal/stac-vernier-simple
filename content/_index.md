              The ***Science & Technology Advancement Center (STAC)***, is a
              nonprofit organization that works with states, districts, and
              companies to design, develop and implement high quality science
              programs. We focus on integrating new and emerging technologies in
              classroom settings to support 3-dimensional learning.

                  At **STAC**, we collaborate with educators and institutions to
                  design, implement, and refine assessment systems that are both
                  meaningful and actionable. Our comprehensive support spans the
                  entire assessment lifecycle from initial development to data
                  analysis and continuous improvement.


                  *Our services include:*


                  * **Assessment Design & Development:** Crafting assessments
                  aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) that
                  promote higher-order thinking and real-world application.<br>

                  * **Review & Validation:** Ensuring assessments are equitable,
                  reliable, and effectively measure intended learning
                  outcomes.<br>

                  * **Data Analysis & Interpretation:** Providing tools and
                  training to help educators analyze assessment data, identify
                  learning trends, and inform instructional decisions.<br>

                  * **Professional Learning:** Offering workshops and coaching
                  to build educators’ capacity in utilizing assessment data to
                  enhance teaching and learning.


                  Our approach is grounded in research and best practices,
                  aiming to create assessment systems that support teaching and
                  foster student growth.

                  At **STAC**, we believe that technology alone doesn’t
                  transform science education, teachers do. Our professional
                  development programs are designed to empower educators with
                  the tools, strategies, and confidence they need to bring
                  emerging technologies into the classroom in meaningful ways.


                  Grounded in research and informed by classroom realities, our
                  sessions go beyond tool training. We support teachers in
                  aligning technology use with the NGSS, fostering inclusive
                  learning environments, and building students’ data literacy
                  and critical thinking. Our recent work includes hands-on
                  training with Vernier probeware and customized support for
                  integrating AI into classroom assessment.


                  **STAC’s** approach is collaborative, practical, and scalable.
                  Whether you’re a district leader looking to strengthen your
                  science instruction or an edtech partner seeking thoughtful
                  implementation strategies, we work alongside you to create
                  sustainable professional learning experiences that make an
                  impact.

                  At **STAC**, our research explores how emerging technologies
                  can deepen student learning and transform science classrooms.
                  In, *Exploring the Data: How Integrating Technology Transforms
                  Science Classrooms*, we highlights the benefits of using tools
                  like Vernier probeware to support student sense-making,
                  inquiry, and real-time data analysis. This work, available on
                  Vernier’s website, reflects our commitment to evidence-based
                  practice and equitable access to high-quality science
                  instruction.


                  Looking ahead, **STAC** is expanding its research efforts to
                  better understand how AI and other technologies can enhance
                  classroom assessment, increase engagement, and support
                  inclusive learning environments. We invite potential partners,
                  from school districts to edtech organizations, to join us as
                  we develop innovative solutions grounded in research and
                  driven by impact.

                  At **STAC**, we support schools, districts, and organizations
                  in creating and refining science curricula that are
                  three-dimensional, inclusive, and grounded in real-world
                  relevance. Our curriculum work is designed to foster deep
                  understanding, promote student agency, and align with the Next
                  Generation Science Standards (NGSS).


                  Whether developing new instructional units or reviewing
                  existing materials, we ensure that science content is
                  accessible, engaging, and rigorous for all learners. Our team
                  brings expertise in universal design, scaffolding for diverse
                  classrooms, and integrating technology in ways that enhance,
                  not overwhelm, learning.


                  **Our services include:**


                  * Collaborative curriculum design aligned to NGSS and local
                  standards<br>

                  * Review and refinement of existing science programs<br>

                  * Integration of probeware and data tools to support
                  inquiry-based learning<br>

                  * Customization for special education and inclusive
                  classrooms<br>

                  * Development of phenomena-driven units and sense-making
                  strategies<br>


                  We partner closely with educators to build curriculum that
                  works in practice, not just on paper. Let us help you design
                  science learning experiences that inspire students and equip
                  them with the skills they need to thrive.

                  At **STAC**, we guide schools, districts, and education
                  agencies in bringing artificial intelligence into teaching and
                  learning—safely, ethically, and impactfully. Our work centers
                  on demystifying AI, empowering educators, and making sure
                  every tool or workflow serves real instructional goals rather
                  than adding noise. From policy design to hands-on coaching, we
                  help you harness AI to deepen student understanding, elevate
                  teacher practice, and advance equity.


                  **Our services include:**


                  * AI readiness road-mapping & policy development<br>

                  * Professional learning series<br>

                  * Dynamic, performance-based assessment design<br>

                  * Equity, bias, and accessibility audits<br>

                  * Pilot-to-scale implementation support<br>


                  We collaborate closely with educators so that AI enriches
                  instruction rather than replacing it, and so that every
                  adoption decision is grounded in evidence and classroom
                  realities.
